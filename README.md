# Cancer_Prediction
# 📌 Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a tumor is benign or malignant using machine learning techniques.
The model is trained on medical data and aims to assist in early cancer detection through data-driven prediction.<br/>
This notebook was developed and executed in Google Colab.
